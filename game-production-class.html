							<h2>Description</h2>
							<p>
								Our objective in the CSG capstone project at the University of Tulsa is to create a game, taking it from the 
								initial development phase through the beta stage to its release on Steam. Within the project, I primarily 
								contribute to the development team, focusing extensively on backend systems that support the game. The game 
								itself is an action-adventure title featuring a Studio Ghibli-inspired aesthetic and centers around the 
								journey of the main character as they embark on a self-discovery adventure.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<h2>Status</h2>
							<p>
								The project is still in its early stages, with a collection of backend and frontend systems in place, albeit 
								loosely connected. Looking ahead, our goal is to further develop and better integrate these systems into the 
								overall gameplay experience.
							</p>
							<p>
								In my role, I have been diligently focused on crafting three key systems: an inventory and item management 
								system, a trait system, and an input handling mechanism. Currently, my efforts are directed towards a 
								comprehensive refinement of the item system.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<h2>Development Logs</h2>
							<!-------->
							<h4>Input handling system</h4>
							<p>
								The input handling system is designed to streamline all player input options within a single, organized script.
								We achieve this by leveraging the Unity Engine's new Input System, which utilizes input action maps.
								These action maps can easily connect with methods in various scripts, relevantly the input handler script.
								To enhance this functionality, I've implemented a series of static C# events that notify any listeners 
								when specific actions are started or canceled.
								Additionally, these events convey associated values like movement vectors, ensuring a comprehensive input broadcasting system.
								Furthermore, this setup facilitates the switching of input action maps, preventing unintended actions during different game states.

							<h4>Trait System</h4>
							<p>
								The aim of the trait system is to effectively manage a set of one-axis values that help determine a player's habits 
								and tendencies during gameplay. This concept is inspired by conventional personality tests, like the 
								<a href=https://www.16personalities.com target="_blank">16 personalities</a>
								test, which encompass two sides of an axis, allowing users to fall anywhere on the spectrum.
								<br>
								Currently, the trait system operates as a leveling mechanism, akin to games like Runescape. At runtime, a Trait Catalog is 
								initialized, parsing through a predefined database of traits. Within this catalog, static events are set up, ready to be triggered. 
								These events receive trait IDs and the amount of experience to be gained, and the trait catalog handles the task of awarding 
								experience points to the relevant traits. Moreover, there are mechanisms in place to broadcast notifications when a specific trait levels up.
